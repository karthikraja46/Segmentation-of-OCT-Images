# Segmentation-of-OCT Images

Diabetic macular edema (DME), a major cause of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy, results from retinal thickening due to fluid accumulation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is crucial for diagnosing DME, with accurate detection relying on precise OCT image segmentation. This study aims to enhance DME detection in OCT images using advanced segmentation algorithms to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies for diabetic patients.

**Material & Methods:** This research compares three architectures—FCNN, SEGNET, and UNET—for segmenting OCT images to detect DME. A publicly accessible dataset was used for training and validation.

**Results:** Performance metrics such as pixel accuracy, precision, recall, Dice coefficient, and IOU score were used to evaluate the systems. UNET outperformed FCNN and SEGNET, achieving a 98.6% accuracy.
